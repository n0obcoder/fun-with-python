<h1>alarm_clock</h1>

This is a simple Alarm Clock that I have built using <strong>playsound</strong> library in Python.

<h2>Installing the required playsound library</h2>

```
pip install playsound
```

<h2>Setting up the alarm</h2>

```
python alarm_clock.py
```

On running the code written above, you get asked how much time later would you like the alarm to go off.
And when the time's up the alarm goes off for <strong>n_rings</strong> number of times (default value is 2), defined in <strong>alarm_clock.py</strong>.
Also there are a few options for the alarm tone which can be changed in <strong>alarm_clock.py</strong>.
